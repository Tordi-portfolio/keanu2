    "body": "I’ve played a lot of shows with Dogstar over the years — from dusty bars to huge open-air festivals. But nothing quite prepared me for the night we played in Kragujevac, Serbia. It was raw, emotional, beautiful — and real in a way that stays with you long after the music fades.\r\n\r\nIt started with the drive into the city. Kragujevac isn’t the kind of place that shouts at you. It doesn’t need to. It hums quietly with history, with scars, and with soul. There’s a stillness in the air that feels sacred. I remember looking out the window, watching old brick buildings roll by under soft July light, thinking — this place has seen things. And that kind of depth... it speaks to me.\r\n\r\nThe venue was intimate, not huge. But the crowd? The crowd felt like the heart of the universe that night.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t just listen — they felt every note. When we started playing “Everything Turns Around,” I saw a girl in the front close her eyes and sway like the music was medicine. I caught the eyes of a man who must’ve been in his sixties, nodding to the beat, mouthing every word. And in that moment, I realized we weren’t just performing — we were connecting. Across cultures, languages, even generations.\r\n\r\nThere was a warmth in that audience I’ll never forget. A sincerity. It wasn’t about celebrity, or hype, or any of that noise. It was about music — pure and unfiltered. About people who showed up not for Keanu Reeves the actor, but for three guys with instruments and something honest to say.\r\n\r\nAfter the show, we hung back longer than usual. People brought gifts — hand-drawn sketches, old Dogstar CDs for us to sign, even local rakija (which I was warned to sip slowly — they weren’t kidding). One woman handed me a worn notebook with lyrics she’d written, saying our music helped her through grief. I didn’t know what to say — so I just hugged her. Sometimes silence says more than words.\r\n\r\nWalking back to the hotel late that night, the streets were quiet, stars stretching over Kragujevac like a soft canopy. I thought about how small the world can feel when you share something real with strangers. About how music lets you do that. It breaks down walls, heals wounds, creates space for joy and pain to live together — and that night, all of it lived in Kragujevac.\r\n\r\nTo the people of Serbia — thank you. You welcomed us with open arms and open hearts. I left a piece of mine with you that night.\r\n\r\nWe’ll be back.\r\n\r\nWith love,\r\nKeanu",

I am endlessly grateful for your friendship and for the hope of spending meaningful, tender moments together. Whether cooking together, sharing laughter, or simply being near you, I look forward to the days when we can create memories filled with warmth, joy, and love.\r\n\r\nConcetta Favazza is truly extraordinary — a friend, a confidante, and a light in my life. I am so lucky to know her, and I hope that one day, I will share with her the joy of simple moments, the comfort of quiet companionship, and the magic of life’s sweetest experiences — together. 💖\r\n\r\n— Keanu Reeves",
